TODO: write a naive FT as validation FFT of a random series.

valid_base : manual valid fft transform.
valid_many : compare fftw many against base.
valid_cuda : compare cuda many against base.

repeatly transform a working size of about 128M to 256M.
report the number of (TPS) transfers per second on varies FFT size.
cuda speed need handle varies working size and batch combination.

speed_base : speed of fftw single interface
speed_many :
speed_cuda :
